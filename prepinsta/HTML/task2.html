        <h3><u> Evolution of Artificial Intelligence</u></h3>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused
          on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require
          human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning,
          problem-solving, understanding natural language, and recognizing
          patterns. AI can be divided into two main categories:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li type="1">
            <strong>Narrow AI (Weak AI): </strong> Designed to perform a
            specific task, such as speech recognition, image classification, or
            language translation. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri
            and Alexa, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
          </li>
          <li type="1">
            <strong>General AI (Strong AI): </strong> A theoretical form of AI
            that would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply
            knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to
            human intelligence. This type of AI remains largely in the realm of
            research and speculation.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <p>AI technologies encompass various subfields, including:</p>
          <li>
            <strong>Machine Learning (ML): </strong>A method of data analysis
            that automates analytical model building. It uses algorithms that
            learn from and make predictions based on data. Deep learning, a
            subset of ML, involves neural networks with many layers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP): </strong>The ability of a
            computer program to understand, interpret, and generate human
            language. Examples include chatbots, language translation services,
            and sentiment analysis tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Computer Vision: </strong>he capability of a machine to
            interpret and make decisions based on visual input from the world.
            This includes facial recognition, object detection, and image
            classification.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          AI applications are rapidly expanding across various sectors,
          including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment,
          driving innovation and improving efficiencies in numerous areas of
          daily life.
